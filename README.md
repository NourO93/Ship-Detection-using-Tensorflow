# Ship-Detection-using-Tensorflow
Using the Airbus ship detection data of satellite images I have created a ship detection model using Squeezenet and Yolo algorithm.

## Training 
I trained the model on google cloud for 3 days untill I burned all my cloud credits. The model achieved an an IOU of 0.342 over test dataset. The model did not performed well on test-dataset.
THe model can be improved by
1-Using squeezenet17
2-Better datasampling
